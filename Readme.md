# Installation Instructions for AntidoteBenchmark<br />

Before you can run mvn install or mvn package on the maven project in this repository you must install some additional dependencies.<br />

Just run the installdependencies.sh (Windows -> run with Git Bash alias Git for Windows) to install all necessary dependencies.

Check the script to make sure it does not do anything you don't want to happen.

The script installs several maven plugins and dependencies that are required to build this project.

In the folder SNAPSHOT_BUILD is the latest build of the project (subject to change because of potential conflicts)

The build is shaded which means it contains everything and can be run anywhere

To run the build, Docker must be running. (Not sure if this will work properly with Linux)

In Windows, the following Docker Settings are required (not sure for Linux)

- In General Settings -> Activate "Expose daemon to tcp://localhost:2375 without TLS"
- In Daemon Setting (not sure if always necessary) -> Use Basic and Deactivate "Experimental features"

Also on Windows the Docker Host is sometimes in a "bad" state which prevents proper interaction with containers.

This typically is the case when Docker starts instantly without needing extra starting time.

If the Docker Host is in a "bad" state this application will tell you and you need to restart Docker.
